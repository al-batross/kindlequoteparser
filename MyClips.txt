What we do know is that there is a complex economy of refugee transportation (an industry worth billions of dollars31); so who is financing it, streamlining it? Where are the European intelligence services to explore this dark netherworld? The fact that refugees are in a desperate situation in no way excludes the possibility that their flow is part of a well-planned project.

Friedman tended to dismiss the significance of neighborhood effects, suggesting that the evils of expanded government power to prevent them generally outweigh any plausible benefit. “It is hard to know when neighborhood effects are sufficiently large to justify particular costs in overcoming them and even harder to distribute the costs in an appropriate fashion,” he wrote in his classic work, Capitalism and Freedom.116 So in the vast majority of cases it would be better to let the market sort things out—

156 But in a pattern that was becoming familiar, the scientific facts were published in a place where few ordinary people would see them, whereas the unscientific claims—that acid rain was not a problem, that it would cost hundreds of billions to fix—were published in mass circulation outlets. It was not a level playing field.

Moreover, there is reason to believe that a straight-out command and control approach might have better results than cap and trade in one important respect: research shows that regulation is an effective means to stimulate technological innovation. That is to say, if you want the market to do its magic—if you want businesses to provide the goods and services that people need—the best way to do that, at least in terms of pollution prevention, appears, paradoxically, to be to mandate it. David Hounshell is one of America’s leading historians of technology. Recently he and his colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University have turned their attention to the question of regulation and technological innovation. In an article published in 2005, “Regulation as the Mother of Innovation,” based on the Ph.D. research of Hounshell’s student, Margaret Taylor, they examined the question of what drives innovation in environmental control technology. It is well established that the lack of immediate financial benefits leads companies to underinvest in R & D, and this general problem is particularly severe when it comes to pollution control. Because pollution prevention is a public good—not well reflected in the market price of goods and services—the incentives for private investment are weak. Competitive forces just don’t provide enough justification for the long-term investment required; there is a lack of driving demand. However, when government establishes a regulation, it creates demand. If companies know they have to meet a firm regulation with a definite deadline, they respond—and innovate. The net result may even be cost savings for the companies, as obsolete technologies are replaced with state-of-the art ones, yet the companies would not have bothered to make the change had they not been forced to.

“We now understand that industrial wastes, such as carbon dioxide released during the burning of fossil fuels, can have consequences for climate that pose a considerable threat to future society … The scientific problems are formidable, the technological problems, unprecedented, and the potential economic and social impacts, ominous.”14 But what matters in science is not the same as what matters in politics

This had very serious consequences: it meant that you might not be able to prove that warming was under way, even though it really was, and by the time you could prove it, it would be too late to stop it.

Verner E. Suomi, chairman of the National Academy’s Climate Research Board, tried to explain this crucial point in his foreword to the Charney report: “The ocean, the great and ponderous flywheel of the global climate system, may be expected to slow the course of observable climatic change. A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.”21 Suomi realized that this conclusion might be “disturbing to policymakers.”22 He was right.

Schelling’s attempt to ignore the cause of global warming was pretty peculiar. It was equivalent to arguing that medical researchers shouldn’t try to cure cancer, because that would be too expensive, and in any case people in the future might decide that dying from cancer is not so bad. But it was based on an ordinary economic principle—the same principle invoked by Fred Singer when discussing acid rain—namely, discounting. A dollar today is worth more to us than a dollar tomorrow and a lot more than a dollar a century from now, so we can “discount” faraway costs. This is what Schelling was doing, presuming that the changes under consideration were “beyond the lifetimes of contemporary decision-makers.”41 Not only did we not know how much energy future populations would use, and therefore how much CO2 they would produce, we didn’t know how they would live, how mobile they would be, what technologies they would have at their disposal, or even what climates they might prefer.

As for migration, “does the Committee really believe that the United States or Western Europe or Canada would accept the huge influx of refugees from poor countries that have suffered a drastic shift in rainfall pattern?,” Weinberg demanded. “I can’t for the life of me see how historic migrations, which generally have taken place when political boundaries were far more permeable than they are now, can tell us anything about migrations 75 to 100 years from now when large areas lose their capacity to support people. Surely there will be times of trouble then.”45

The Institute might have disbanded—its raison d’être disappeared—but instead, the old Cold Warriors decided to fight on. The new enemy? Environmental “alarmists.” In 1989—the very year the Berlin Wall fell—the Marshall Institute issued its first report attacking climate science. Within a few years, they would be attacking climate scientists as well.

Whatever the reasons and justifications of our protagonists, there’s another crucial element to our story. It’s how the mass media became complicit, as a wide spectrum of the media—not just obviously right-wing newspapers like the Washington Times, but mainstream outlets, too—felt obligated to treat these issues as scientific controversies. Journalists were constantly pressured to grant the professional deniers equal status—and equal time and newsprint space—and they did.

Many liberals and academics agree that without change in our energy technologies, there will be no solution to global warming. The question is not whether we turn to technology for help; the question is whether we can assume that free markets will produce those technologies freely, of their own accord. The question is also whether they will do so in time—so we can relax in the comforting knowledge that they will—or whether we need to get out of our chairs and do something.
