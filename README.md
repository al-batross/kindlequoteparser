# readme  
A script which implements some basic functions and class-method to parse a Amazon Kindle's *My Clippings.txt* file into a pandas dataframe. This file contains all the underlined text in every kindle document, either purchased on Amazon or copied to the device. The pandas dataframe has the following columns: author, title, quote and date. It assumes the file is written in Spanish, so the dates in the file are parsed to datetime type converting the months in Spanish to a number. The quotes are classified as True Quotes using the naive criteria: if it has more than one word, is a quote, otherwise is not. If it isn't a quote, the column cleanword stores the word *without any punctuation* etc that my be present in the original txt file. An example is shown in another file with a main function. A test file from my own kindle is included for testing.
